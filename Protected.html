           Protected Birds
       </h1>
       <p>
            There are a number of birds in Ireland whose numbers are in decline. Some of those with a high priority for conservation are:
       </p>
       <h2>
           <strong>Barn Owl</strong>
       </h2>
       <p>
            The barn owl is the most common owl and is found in most parts of the world. 
            It has seen a huge decline in Ireland and Europe in recent years.

       <h2>
            <strong>Curlew</strong>
       </h2>
        <p>
            The curlew is recognisable by its long curved bill.
        </p>

        <p>
            Curlews use their long bills to search for worms in mud or very soft ground.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <strong>Yellowhammer</strong>
       </h2>
        <p>
            The yellowhammer is a large bunting with a yellow head and a streaked brown back.
            It usually lives in dry, open countryside with some trees or hedges.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <strong>Lapwing</strong>
       </h2>
        <p>
            The lapwing is black and white with a wispy crest.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a wader which means you can see it in wetland areas.
